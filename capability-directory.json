  "overview": "<p>The Australian Research Council (ARC) Industrial Transformation Research Hub to Advance Timber for Australia&rsquo;s Future Built Environment (Advance Timber Hub) is administered by The University of Queensland. The Hub supports the transformation of Australia&rsquo;s timber and construction sectors so that sustainable timber is the material of choice for Australia&rsquo;s built environment. The Hub is stimulating growth in innovation, increasing the uptake of sustainable timber products used in buildings, and establishing a roadmap for change.<\/p><p>The Hub&rsquo;s research is focused on three over-arching themes of Innovative Solutions, Transformative Benefits and Planning Change and is undertaken through eight inter-related Research Nodes and their projects.<\/p><p>The expected outcomes will help Australia&rsquo;s timber and construction sectors transition to a circular and net-zero economy.<\/p>",

  "overview": "<p>The QUT Centre for Data Science draws together capability in data science from across Australia, providing a centralised hub for world-class data science research. We collaborate to develop novel data science methods for domain-specific research, to solve real-world challenges. Our new methods for visualisation, communication and interpretation of data and analyses allow for improved decision-making, and the critical evaluation of issues related to the role and use of data science in society. We use new models to describe and make decisions about complex systems. We develop scalable, efficient computational algorithms for analysing dimensional and highly structured data. We are advancing the medical, physical, technological and social sciences through the development and application of new data science methods to achieve rigorous scientific discovery and generate evidence-based insights.<\/p>",

  "overview": "<p>The Centre for International Trade and Business in Asia (CITBA) is a cutting-edge research centre located at James Cook University. With its headquarter in Australia, and as the only research centre within the College of Business, Law, and Governance (CBLG) at James Cook University Australia, CITBA is dedicated to providing leadership in research excellence.<\/p><p>Since its establishment in 2018, CITBA has focused on researching key areas such as tropical ecosystems, conservation and climate change, industries and economies in the tropics, and people and societies in the tropics. It has grown to include more than 50 scholars from both James Cook University Australia and James Cook University Singapore. The goal of CITBA is to increase and share knowledge about the opportunities in economic development, business and international trade in Asia and the Asian Tropics. CITBA actively advocates for research and industry engagement in the business and international trading hub of Asia and the Asian Tropics, and with its multi-location structure, it works to strengthen research and economic ties between Australia, Singapore, and other countries.<\/p><p>CITBA conducts a variety of activities to support its research goals. Some examples of these activities include:<\/p><ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\"><li>Research Projects: CITBA conducts original research on topics related to international trade and business in Asia, such as trade policy, business strategies, and economic development in the region.<\/li><li>Workshops and Conferences: CITBA also hosts conferences and workshops to bring together scholars and industry leaders to discuss current research and trends in the field.<\/li><li>Public Outreach: CITBA engages in public outreach activities to share its research findings with the broader community. This may include publishing articles, creating educational resources, or giving public talks.<\/li><li>Collaboration: CITBA collaborates with other research centres, universities, government agencies, and businesses to further its research goals.<\/li><li>Partnership: CITBA also have partnerships with other Universities or research centres, to share knowledge and resources and to expand their research scope.<\/li><\/ol>",

This research is complemented by studies into physiological ageing. A major aim of the Centre is the development of therapeutic interventions to delay the onset, prevent and even cure dementia in patients, as well as new drugs and better methods to deliver them to the brain. Another aim is the development of biomarkers to diagnose dementia earlier, more cheaply, and with higher sensitivity and specificity, and to monitor therapeutic interventions.<\/p>",

Chemists in academia and research organisations have compounds &lsquo;sitting on shelves&rsquo; that were not designed as antibiotics and would not otherwise be screened for antimicrobial activity.

While these research areas are all important in their own right, from the perspective of the FIRC, they all interact with each other in real ways to have important impact.

Current research projects focus on four big neglected problems in health care: antibiotic resistance; overdiagnosis; non-drug treatments; and waste in research. This research is supported by our work on the development of methods, tools, and capacity. The key areas of focus include: the applicability of treatments to individuals, the effectiveness of diagnostic and disease monitoring processes, and the cognitive processes underpinning clinicians\u2019 decisions about diagnosis and treatment.<\/p>",

We focus on legumes because of their wide role in human and environmental well-being, their special ability to enter a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with soil bacteria, and their broad scientific database in phytochemistry, genetics, genomics and physiology. Our scientists aim to understand how plant cells communicate, grow and differentiate. Research into plant physiology, molecular and cell biology is providing fundamental insights into developing enhanced food production, agricultural sustainability, environmental quality and products for human health.<\/p>",

Language and culture documentation follows archiving procedures which involve various types of multimedia files and interactive data bases. The empirical results feed into scientifically proven inductive generalisations concerning human language capacity, and the interactions between parameters of linguistic and cultural behaviour. LCRC's primary focus is on the indigenous people of New Guinea, Australia, Amazonia and East Asia. The LCRC works in terms of basic linguistic theory, the cumulative framework for linguistic documentation.

It houses over 900,000 of the state&rsquo;s plant specimen collection, representing Queensland&rsquo;s native and naturalised plant species, and 150 years of species discovery. The Herbarium is central to the research, identification and dissemination of information on the state&rsquo;s plants, fungi, algae and animals, and the ecosystems they inhabit.<\/p><p>Queensland&rsquo;s ecosystems have been surveyed, mapped and classified into 1386 regional ecosystems across the state, and are the subject of ecological research, condition assessment and monitoring. Work at the Herbarium contributes to the better management of Queensland's natural environment now and for future generations.<\/p><p>The Herbarium collections are internationally recognised under Index Herbariorum as BRI.

  "overview": "<p>Building on over a decade of QUT and federal strategic investment, the QUT Centre for Robotics (QCR) conducts world-leading research in intelligent robotics. We translate fundamental research into real-world outcomes that benefit industry and society. Our research strengths are in: how robots interact with the physical world; how a robot or autonomous vehicle uses perception to create maps and calculate and track its location in the world); how a robot can learn to reliably interpret its environment, and build an internal representation of its surroundings in order to decide on its actions; and how to reliably make autonomous decisions and control for robots in the presence of uncertainty. Our experts are leaders in education, training and development of talent in robotics and autonomous systems, and provide leadership in technological policy development and societal debate.<\/p>",
